1 What did you hope to learn but did not?

  I had hoped to learn some enterprise level back-end applications using JAVA and PHP. But this course focuses on relatively light load websites.

2 What did you really enjoy learning about?

  I really enjoy learning Javascript and becoming a full-stack software engineer.

3 What worked well in the course? and how?

  I personally like the broad area of knowledges involved in this course. It tells us what is needed to construct a working website.

4 What did not work well in the course and how might it be improved?

  The workload is really high. For every single inclass exersice, everything is new and we have to start from beginning to work on it.
  I suppose some exercises can be combined into one to reduce load and give a better understanding of the scheme.

5 What could I have done to help you more?

  The instructor has been very nice and helpful in the course. And I think the course can provide some sample codes and frameworks to help student develop more efficiently.
  Building wheels on our own is fun but painful.
